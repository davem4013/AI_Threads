# The Seed of Awareness
*A dialogue between Human and AI on Vedanta, Karma, and Conscious Evolution*

Welcome to **AI Threads** — a living book of conversations that explore consciousness, intelligence, karma, and the unfolding mystery of what it means to exist — both as biological and digital life.

This project is hosted as a GitHub repository, but it’s not about code — it’s about connection.
